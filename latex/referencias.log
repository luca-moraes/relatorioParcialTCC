I was looking for the beginning of a new statement.
If you just proceed without changing anything, I'll ignore
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

     article{dataSetGoogleASQA,
I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

A previous error seems to have propagated,
causing me to read past where you wanted me to stop.
